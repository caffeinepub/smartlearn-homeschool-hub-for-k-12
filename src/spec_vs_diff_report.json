Role-based access updates for Educator/Parent vs Student appear partially addressed in the Dashboard/LessonPlansTab interface, but backend-side authorization/error-string updates for lesson-plan creation are not evidenced in the provided diff. The diff also includes app publish/unpublish (maintenance mode) functionality that is not part of this BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff shows backend/main.mo changes, but the provided snippet contains publish/unpublish authorization strings and does not show any lesson-plan creation authorization checks or error/trap strings being updated.
