However, the diff provides no clear evidence that the backend premium access duration and backend-provided premium pricing strings were updated, and it’s not fully verifiable from the provided snippets that all remaining frontend references to “3 months” (including the Report Cards upgrade UI pricing display) were removed/updated.",
